Web Developer Bootcamp

Hi,

I am new to coding. I am currently learning web development and I am really enjoying myself. Here are all the projects that I have worked on so far.

I will be creating folders for each section/language that I cover and upload all files relating to that section.

Would appreciate any feedback as well as and tips. It would be great to get project ideas, learning resources and any other tips or tricks that will help accelerate my learning. 

Thanks!
